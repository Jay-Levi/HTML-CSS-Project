# London Social Club
## The Purpose
London Social Club (or LSC for short) was developed for the purpose of helping those who have trouble socialising or want to socialise with others, the idea for the site came from seeing many articles about how a lot of people are still having trouble getting back into normality since being in quarantine/lockdown deprived a lot of people of the social aspects of there lives. LSC provides a bridge for those wanting to connect with new people in London.
